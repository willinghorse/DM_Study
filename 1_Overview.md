# Introduction
## Key Competency in Data Era
**Key Competency = Domain Speciality + Data + Infrastructure + DM / ML Capacity**

### Domain Speciality
Also as domain knowledge. This is something inherited from sepacific business a company conducts. 
It also implies the insights and sophistication accumulated by day-to-day business.

Nowdays with the fast development of AI/ML, people are looking for new domains of application. 
Take the self-piloting car for example, once a new domain is found companies would rush in for a better postition.
Domain knowledge plays a key role in the success of AI / ML application. Imaginations are needed to find more domain of new AI / ML applications.

### Data
Data enables all the analysis and applications one company could possibly built. Now since the algorithms and methodologies largely open and available, data is more crutial to the sucess of one company. In a sense it determines the upper limits one company could possibly achieve in data era. Some internet giants like Google, Facebook are clearly at advantage due to data they possessed.

## Infrastructure
Infrastructure refers to the implementation paltform all sophisticated models and analysis built upon. It includes both hardwares and middleware 
Parrell Computing
GPU
FPGA
ASIC
Quamtum Computer


## DM / ML Capacity
