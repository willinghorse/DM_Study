# Jie's Notes on Statistical Learning

## Objective
This folder is set up to facilitate the group study and discussion of data mining & machine learning between Jie and his friends. Notes from this folder centering topics on **statistical learning**. More specifically, it focuses on more classical models like linear regression, logistic regression, tree methods, etc. For now the **deep learning** and related methodologies would not be discussed under this folder.

## Approach
The notes and discussions under this folder would try to find a balance between theory and application. On theory side, it would dwell on the model's assumptions, mathematical implication, searching algorithm, limitations, etc. On application side, the notes would also try to cover topics like code realization, performance optimization, etc.

## References
The notes and discussions root from the following books & videos:
